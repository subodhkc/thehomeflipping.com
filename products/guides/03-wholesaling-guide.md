## What is Wholesaling?

### The Basics

Wholesaling is the art of finding deeply discounted properties, getting them under contract, and selling that contract to another investor for a profit. You never actually buy the property - you sell your right to buy it.

**Think of it like this:** You find a $200,000 house that a motivated seller will sell for $120,000. You get it under contract for $120,000, then sell that contract to a cash buyer for $135,000. You pocket $15,000 without ever owning the property.

### Why Wholesaling is Perfect for Beginners

| Advantage | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| No money needed | You don't buy the property |
| No credit needed | No loans involved |
| No renovation risk | Buyer handles all repairs |
| Fast profits | 2-4 weeks per deal |
| Low risk | Worst case: deal falls through |
| Learn the business | Understand values, repairs, negotiation |

### The Numbers

**Typical Wholesale Deal:**
- Find property worth $200,000 (ARV)
- Seller agrees to $110,000
- You contract at $110,000
- Sell contract to flipper for $125,000
- **Your profit: $15,000**

**Time Investment:** 10-20 hours total
**Cash Investment:** $0 (earnest money is refundable if structured correctly)

### Is Wholesaling Legal?

Yes, wholesaling is legal in all 50 states. However, some states have specific requirements:

- **Disclosure**: Some states require you to disclose you're assigning the contract
- **Licensing**: A few states require a real estate license for certain wholesale activities
- **Contract Language**: Your purchase agreement must allow assignment

**Always consult a local real estate attorney to ensure compliance.**

### Overview

Step 1: Find Motivated Seller
         ↓
Step 2: Analyze the Deal
         ↓
Step 3: Make Offer & Get Under Contract
         ↓
Step 4: Find Cash Buyer
         ↓
Step 5: Assign Contract
         ↓
Step 6: Close & Get Paid
```

### Step 1: Find Motivated Sellers

**Who Are Motivated Sellers?**

People who need to sell quickly and will accept below-market offers:

- **Distressed Situations**
  - Facing foreclosure
  - Behind on taxes
  - Divorce
  - Job loss/relocation
  - Death in family (probate)

- **Property Issues**
  - Inherited property they don't want
  - Tired landlords
  - Vacant properties
  - Properties needing major repairs
  - Code violations

- **Life Circumstances**
  - Downsizing seniors
  - Relocating for work
  - Health issues
  - Financial problems

### Step 2: Analyze the Deal

**The Wholesale Formula:**

```
Maximum Offer = (ARV × 70%) - Repairs - Your Fee

Example:
ARV = $200,000
Repairs = $30,000
Your Fee = $15,000

Max Offer = ($200,000 × 0.70) - $30,000 - $15,000
Max Offer = $140,000 - $30,000 - $15,000
Max Offer = $95,000
```

**Your buyer (the flipper) needs room to profit too!**

### Step 3: Get Under Contract

Use a purchase agreement with an assignment clause:

> "Buyer reserves the right to assign this contract to a third party prior to closing."

**Key Contract Terms:**
- Inspection period (14-30 days) - your exit strategy
- Earnest money ($100-$1,000) - refundable during inspection
- Closing date (30-45 days) - time to find buyer
- Assignment clause - allows you to sell the contract

### Step 4: Find Cash Buyer

Build your buyers list BEFORE you have deals:
- REIA meetings
- Facebook groups
- Craigslist ads
- Bandit signs
- Title company referrals

### Step 5: Assign the Contract

Two methods:

**A. Assignment of Contract**
- Sell your contract rights to buyer
- Buyer sees your profit (assignment fee)
- Simpler, one closing

**B. Double Close**
- You close with seller (A-B)
- Immediately close with buyer (B-C)
- Buyer doesn't see your profit
- Requires transactional funding

### Step 6: Close and Get Paid

- Title company handles everything
- Assignment fee paid at closing
- Funds typically same day or next day

## Finding Deals on Zillow

### The Zillow Goldmine

Zillow is free and full of motivated sellers if you know what to look for.

### Search Filters to Use

1. **For Sale By Owner (FSBO)**
   - Filter: "For Sale by Owner"
   - These sellers are trying to avoid agent fees
   - Often more flexible on price

2. **Price Reduced**
   - Look for multiple price drops
   - Indicates motivation
   - Check "Price History"

3. **Days on Market**
   - Filter for 60+ days
   - Longer = more motivated
   - Stale listings are opportunities

4. **Keywords in Description**
   Search for these terms:
   - "As-is"
   - "Investor special"
   - "Handyman special"
   - "Needs work"
   - "Estate sale"
   - "Motivated"
   - "Must sell"
   - "Bring all offers"
   - "Priced to sell"
   - "Fixer upper"

### Step-by-Step Zillow Process

**Step 1: Set Up Your Search**
1. Go to Zillow.com
2. Enter your target city/zip code
3. Click "For Sale"
4. Set price range (focus on lower end of market)
5. Filter for "For Sale by Owner" if available

**Step 2: Identify Potential Deals**
Look for:
- Properties priced below comparable sales
- Distressed photos (dated interiors, deferred maintenance)
- Keyword triggers in description
- Multiple price reductions
- Long days on market

**Step 3: Run Quick Analysis**
For each potential deal:
1. Note the asking price
2. Find 3-5 comparable sales (Zillow "Nearby Sales")
3. Estimate ARV (what it would sell for fixed up)
4. Estimate repairs (use our calculator)
5. Calculate your max offer

**Step 4: Contact the Seller**
- Call or text (preferred over email)
- Be direct but friendly
- Ask about their situation
- Listen for motivation

**Sample Script:**

> "Hi, I saw your property on Zillow at [Address]. I'm a local investor and I'm interested in making you a cash offer. I can close quickly and buy as-is. Would you be open to discussing it? What's the best price you could accept for a quick, hassle-free sale?"

### Zillow Deal Qualification Checklist

Before making an offer, verify:

- [ ] ARV confirmed with 3+ comps
- [ ] Repair estimate completed
- [ ] Numbers work at 70% rule minus your fee
- [ ] Seller is motivated (why are they selling?)
- [ ] No major title issues visible
- [ ] Property is in your target area
- [ ] You have buyers who want this type of property

## Qualifying Properties

### The 5-Minute Property Analysis

**Step 1: Determine ARV (2 minutes)**

Find 3-5 comparable sales:
- Same neighborhood (within 1 mile)
- Similar size (within 20% sq ft)
- Similar bed/bath count
- Sold within 6 months
- In renovated condition

**Calculate average price per square foot of comps, then:**
```
ARV = Comp $/sqft × Subject Property Sqft
```

**Step 2: Estimate Repairs (2 minutes)**

Quick repair categories:

| Condition | Cost per Sq Ft |
|-----------|----------------|
| Light cosmetic | $10-15/sqft |
| Medium rehab | $20-30/sqft |
| Heavy rehab | $40-60/sqft |
| Full gut | $80-100+/sqft |

**Light Cosmetic:** Paint, carpet, fixtures, cleaning
**Medium Rehab:** Kitchen/bath updates, flooring, some systems
**Heavy Rehab:** Full kitchen/bath remodel, roof, HVAC, electrical
**Full Gut:** Down to studs, everything new

**Step 3: Calculate Max Offer (1 minute)**

```
Max Offer = (ARV × 0.70) - Repairs - Your Fee

Example:
1,500 sqft house
Comps at $150/sqft = $225,000 ARV
Medium rehab = $30/sqft = $45,000
Your fee = $10,000

Max Offer = ($225,000 × 0.70) - $45,000 - $10,000
Max Offer = $157,500 - $45,000 - $10,000
Max Offer = $102,500
```

### Red Flags to Avoid

**Property Red Flags:**
- Foundation issues (cracks, uneven floors)
- Flood zone without insurance
- Environmental contamination
- Structural damage
- Unpermitted additions
- Zoning issues

**Seller Red Flags:**
- Multiple owners who disagree
- Liens exceeding property value
- Seller not on title
- Unrealistic price expectations
- Unwilling to provide access

**Deal Red Flags:**
- Numbers don't work at 70% rule
- No comparable sales available
- Declining neighborhood
- No buyer interest in area

### The "Sniff Test"

Ask yourself:
1. Would I buy this property myself?
2. Can I find a buyer in 2 weeks?
3. Is there enough meat on the bone for everyone?
4. What could go wrong?

If you hesitate on any answer, dig deeper or pass.

## Getting Properties Under Contract

### The Purchase Agreement

Your contract must include:

**Essential Clauses:**

1. **Assignment Clause**
```
"Buyer, or Buyer's assigns, reserves the right to assign 
this Agreement to a third party prior to closing without 
the consent of Seller."
```

2. **Inspection Contingency**
```
"This Agreement is contingent upon Buyer's approval of 
a property inspection within [14-30] days of acceptance. 
Buyer may terminate this Agreement for any reason during 
the inspection period and receive a full refund of 
earnest money."
```

3. **Clear Title Contingency**
```
"This Agreement is contingent upon Seller providing 
clear and marketable title at closing."
```

### Earnest Money Strategy

**How Much:**
- $100 - $1,000 typical for wholesale deals
- Enough to show you're serious
- Not so much you can't walk away

**Protection:**
- Deposit with title company (not seller)
- Ensure inspection contingency protects you
- Refundable if you cancel during inspection period

**Pro Tip:** Some wholesalers use $10 earnest money. While legal, it may make sellers suspicious. $500 is a good balance.

### Negotiation Scripts

**Initial Offer:**
> "Based on the condition and the repairs needed, I can offer $[X]. I know that's below your asking price, but I'm paying cash, closing in 2 weeks, and buying as-is. You won't have to fix anything, pay any commissions, or wait for a buyer's financing to come through."

**When They Counter:**
> "I understand you'd like more. Help me understand - what's driving your timeline? If we can close faster, would that help? My offer is based on the repairs I'll need to make. Let me walk you through the numbers..."

**Closing the Deal:**
> "If we can agree on $[X], I can have the contract to you today and we can close in [timeframe]. Does that work for you?"

### After Getting Under Contract

**Immediately:**
1. Send contract to title company
2. Order title search
3. Take photos/video of property
4. Start marketing to buyers

**Within 48 Hours:**
1. Blast to your buyers list
2. Post on investor Facebook groups
3. Put up bandit signs (if legal in your area)
4. List on Craigslist

## Finding Cash Buyers

### Building Your Buyers List

**Your buyers list is your most valuable asset.** Build it BEFORE you have deals.

### Where to Find Cash Buyers

**1. County Records**
Look for recent cash purchases:
- Search for LLC or Trust buyers
- Properties bought without mortgages
- Multiple purchases by same entity

**2. REIA Meetings**
- Attend every meeting
- Collect business cards
- Ask "What are you looking for?"
- Follow up with everyone

**3. Facebook Groups**
Join and participate in:
- "[Your City] Real Estate Investors"
- "Wholesale Real Estate [Your State]"
- "Cash Buyers [Your City]"

**4. Craigslist**
Post ads:
- "Investment Property Available - Cash Buyers Only"
- "Wholesale Deal - [City] - [Price]"

**5. Bandit Signs**
"We Buy Houses" signs attract:
- Sellers (leads for you)
- Other investors (potential buyers)

**6. Title Companies**
Ask title officers:
- "Who are your most active cash buyers?"
- "Can you introduce me to investors?"

**7. Property Management Companies**
They know landlords who:
- Buy rental properties
- Pay cash
- Buy frequently

### Qualifying Your Buyers

**Questions to Ask:**

1. What areas do you buy in?
2. What property types? (SFR, multi, commercial)
3. What's your typical purchase price range?
4. How quickly can you close?
5. Do you have proof of funds?
6. How many properties have you bought this year?
7. What's your preferred contact method?

### Organizing Your Buyers List

Create a spreadsheet with:

|-------|---------|
| Name | John Smith |
| Company | Smith Investments LLC |
| Phone | 555-123-4567 |

| Price Range | $100K - $250K |

## Assigning Your Contract

### Method 1: Assignment of Contract

**How It Works:**
1. You have contract with seller at $100,000
2. You find buyer willing to pay $115,000
3. You sign Assignment Agreement with buyer

5. Buyer closes with seller at $100,000
6. One closing, you get paid at closing

**Pros:**
- Simple, one closing
- Lower closing costs
- Faster process

**Cons:**

- Some sellers don't allow assignment
- Some buyers uncomfortable with large fees

**Assignment Agreement Essentials:**

```
ASSIGNMENT OF REAL ESTATE PURCHASE AGREEMENT

Assignor: [Your Name/Company]
Assignee: [Buyer Name/Company]
Property: [Address]
Original Contract Date: [Date]
Original Purchase Price: $[Amount]
Assignment Fee: $[Amount]

Assignor hereby assigns all rights, title, and interest 
in the Purchase Agreement to Assignee. Assignee agrees 
to perform all obligations under the original Agreement.

Assignment Fee of $[Amount] is due at closing and shall 
be paid from Assignee's funds.
```

### Method 2: Double Close

4. You immediately close with buyer (same day)
5. Your profit is hidden from both parties

**Pros:**
- Buyer doesn't see your profit
- Works when assignment isn't allowed
- Better for large assignment fees
