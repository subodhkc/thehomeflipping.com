## Understanding Flip Financing

### Why Traditional Banks Don't Work for Flipping

Traditional mortgages are designed for owner-occupants, not investors. Here's why they fail for flipping:

| Factor | Traditional Mortgage | Flip Financing Need |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Approval Time | 30-45 days | 7-14 days |
| Property Condition | Must be habitable | Often distressed |
| Income Verification | Extensive | Asset-based |
| Number of Loans | Limited (usually 4-10) | Unlimited |
| Renovation Funds | Not included | Built into loan |

### Types of Flip Financing

1. **Hard Money Loans** - Asset-based, fast, higher rates
2. **Private Money** - Individual investors, negotiable terms
3. **DSCR Loans** - Debt Service Coverage Ratio loans
4. **Home Equity** - Use equity in existing property
5. **Business Lines of Credit** - Revolving credit
6. **Partnerships** - Split profits for capital
7. **Seller Financing** - Owner carries the note
8. **Self-Directed IRA** - Use retirement funds

## Hard Money Lenders Explained

### What is Hard Money?

Hard money loans are short-term, asset-based loans secured by real estate. The "hard" refers to the hard asset (the property) rather than your credit score or income.

### Key Characteristics

| Feature | Typical Terms |
|---------|---------------|
| Loan Term | 6-18 months |
| Interest Rate | 10-15% annually |
| Points (Origination Fee) | 2-4 points (2-4% of loan) |
| LTV (Loan-to-Value) | 65-75% of ARV |
| LTC (Loan-to-Cost) | 80-90% of purchase + rehab |
| Closing Time | 7-14 days |
| Prepayment Penalty | Usually none |

### How Hard Money Differs from Traditional Lending

**Traditional Bank Loan:**
- Based on YOUR creditworthiness
- Requires income verification, tax returns
- 30-45 day closing
- Low rates (6-8%)
- Long terms (15-30 years)
- Property must be in good condition

**Hard Money Loan:**
- Based on the PROPERTY'S value
- Minimal income verification
- 7-14 day closing
- Higher rates (10-15%)
- Short terms (6-18 months)
- Distressed properties OK

### When to Use Hard Money

**Ideal Situations:**
- Auction purchases requiring fast cash
- Distressed properties banks won't finance
- When you need to close quickly (competitive market)
- Fix and flip projects
- Bridge financing between properties
- When traditional financing isn't available

**Not Ideal For:**
- Long-term holds (rates too high)
- Properties you plan to live in
- Deals with thin margins (costs eat profit)

### Hard Money Cost Example

**Property Details:**
- Purchase Price: $150,000
- Rehab Budget: $40,000
- ARV: $250,000
- Hold Time: 6 months

**Hard Money Terms:**
- LTV: 70% of ARV = $175,000 loan
- Interest Rate: 12% annually
- Points: 3 points = $5,250
- Monthly Interest: $175,000 × 12% ÷ 12 = $1,750

**Total Financing Costs:**
- Points: $5,250
- Interest (6 months): $10,500
- Total: $15,750

**Profit Calculation:**
- Sale Price: $250,000
- Purchase: $150,000
- Rehab: $40,000
- Financing: $15,750
- Closing Costs (buy + sell): ~$15,000
- **Net Profit: $29,250**

### The Private Money Pitch

**What Private Lenders Want to Hear:**

1. **Security** - Their investment is secured by real estate
2. **Returns** - Better than CDs, bonds, or savings accounts
3. **Passive** - They do nothing, you do the work
4. **Track Record** - You know what you're doing
5. **Exit Strategy** - How and when they get paid back

**Sample Pitch Script:**

> "I'm looking for investment partners who want to earn 8-10% returns secured by real estate. Here's how it works: You lend me $100,000 for a property I'm renovating. Your investment is secured by a first-position lien on the property, just like a bank. The property is worth $180,000 after repairs, so you have plenty of equity protection. In 6 months when I sell, you get your $100,000 back plus $5,000 in interest. You do nothing except collect a check. Would you like to see my current project?"

### Structuring Private Money Deals

**Common Structures:**

1. **Straight Loan**
   - Fixed interest rate (8-12%)
   - Monthly or balloon payment
   - Secured by deed of trust/mortgage

2. **Equity Partnership**
   - Lender provides capital
   - You provide expertise and labor
   - Split profits 50/50 or negotiated

3. **Hybrid**
   - Preferred return (8%) plus profit share
   - Lender gets paid first, then split remaining profit

**Legal Protection for Both Parties:**

- Promissory note (loan terms)
- Deed of trust or mortgage (security)
- Title insurance
- Hazard insurance (lender as loss payee)
- Personal guarantee (optional)

## Creative Financing Strategies

### Subject-To Financing

**What It Is:**
Buying a property "subject to" the existing mortgage. The loan stays in the seller's name, but you take over payments and ownership.

**How It Works:**
1. Find motivated seller with existing mortgage
2. Negotiate to take over their payments
3. Deed transfers to you
4. Original loan stays in seller's name
5. You make payments directly to lender
6. Flip property and pay off loan

**Best For:**
- Sellers behind on payments
- Sellers who need to move quickly
- Properties with low-interest existing loans

**Risks:**
- Due-on-sale clause (lender can call loan due)
- Seller's credit still tied to property
- Requires trust between parties

### Seller Financing

**What It Is:**
The seller acts as the bank and finances your purchase.

**How It Works:**
1. Negotiate purchase price and terms with seller
2. Seller carries a note (you make payments to them)
3. Deed transfers to you
4. You renovate and sell
5. Pay off seller's note at sale

**Typical Terms:**
- 5-10% down payment
- 6-10% interest rate
- 1-5 year balloon
- Monthly payments

**Best For:**
- Sellers who own property free and clear
- Sellers wanting passive income
- Properties that don't qualify for traditional financing

### Partnerships

**Types of Partnerships:**

1. **Money Partner + Work Partner**
   - One provides capital
   - One finds deals and manages project
   - Split profits 50/50

2. **Joint Venture**
   - Both contribute capital
   - Both contribute expertise
   - Split based on contribution

3. **Silent Partner**
   - Investor provides all capital
   - You do all work
   - Investor gets preferred return + profit share

**Partnership Agreement Essentials:**

- Capital contributions
- Roles and responsibilities
- Decision-making authority
- Profit/loss distribution
- Exit strategy
- Dispute resolution
- What happens if project fails

5. Close in 7-14 days

**What You Need:**

### Solution 2: Transactional Funding

**What It Is:**
Very short-term funding (1-3 days) specifically for double closings and assignments.

2. You find buyer at $120,000

### Solution 4: Proof of Funds Services

**What They Are:**
Services that provide proof of funds letters for a fee, without actually lending you money.

**Important:** These only work if you have actual funding lined up. They're for showing proof to get access to deals, not for actually closing.

**When to Use:**
- Getting on New Western's buyer list
- Accessing off-market deal sources
- Showing sellers you're serious
