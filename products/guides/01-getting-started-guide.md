## Understanding House Flipping

### What is House Flipping?

House flipping is the practice of purchasing a property, improving it, and selling it for a profit. The typical flip timeline is 3-6 months from purchase to sale.

### The Two Main Strategies

**1. Traditional Flip (Fix & Flip)**
- Buy distressed property below market value
- Renovate to increase value
- Sell at full market price
- Typical profit: $20,000 - $80,000 per flip
- Requires: Capital, contractors, 3-6 months

**2. Wholesale Flip (Assignment)**
- Find distressed property
- Get it under contract
- Sell the contract to another investor
- Typical profit: $5,000 - $50,000 per deal
- Requires: Marketing, negotiation, 2-4 weeks
- **No money or credit needed**

### Key Terms You Must Know

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **ARV** | After Repair Value - what the home is worth fully renovated |
| **MAO** | Maximum Allowable Offer - highest price you should pay |
| **Rehab** | Renovation/repair work needed |
| **Comps** | Comparable properties that recently sold |
| **Equity** | The difference between value and what's owed |
| **Distressed** | Property in poor condition or motivated seller |
| **Assignment** | Selling your contract rights to another buyer |

### The 70% Rule

**Never pay more than 70% of ARV minus repairs.**

```
MAO = (ARV × 0.70) - Repair Costs

Example:
ARV = $200,000
Repairs = $30,000
MAO = ($200,000 × 0.70) - $30,000
MAO = $140,000 - $30,000
MAO = $110,000 (Maximum you should offer)
```

## Finding Properties Manually

### Method 1: Driving for Dollars

The most effective free method for finding deals.

**What to Look For:**
- Overgrown lawns and landscaping
- Boarded windows or broken glass
- Peeling paint, damaged siding
- Mail/newspapers piling up
- Code violation notices
- "For Sale By Owner" signs
- Vacant properties

**How to Do It:**
1. Choose a target neighborhood (older homes, 1950s-1980s)
2. Drive every street systematically
3. Note addresses of distressed properties
4. Take photos for reference
5. Use apps like DealMachine or BatchLeads to find owner info
6. Send direct mail or call owners

**Sample Script for Calling Owners:**

> "Hi, my name is [Your Name]. I'm a local real estate investor and I noticed your property at [Address]. I'm looking to buy homes in the area and was wondering if you'd ever consider selling? I can close quickly and buy as-is, no repairs needed on your end."

### Method 2: Zillow & Online Listings

**Finding Motivated Sellers on Zillow:**

1. Search your target area
2. Filter for:
   - "For Sale By Owner" (FSBO)
   - Price reductions (multiple drops = motivated)
   - Days on market 60+ days
   - "As-is" in description
   - Estate sales or inherited properties

3. Look for keywords in descriptions:
   - "Investor special"
   - "Handyman special"
   - "Needs work"
   - "Sold as-is"
   - "Estate sale"
   - "Motivated seller"
   - "Must sell"
   - "Relocating"

**Red Flags to Avoid:**
- Properties with foundation issues (unless you're experienced)
- Flood zones without proper insurance
- Environmental contamination
- Title issues or liens

### Method 3: Craigslist & Facebook Marketplace

**Craigslist Strategy:**
1. Search "Real Estate - By Owner"
2. Look for distressed property keywords
3. Contact sellers directly
4. Also post "We Buy Houses" ads

**Facebook Marketplace:**
1. Search "house for sale" in your area
2. Filter by price (look for underpriced)
3. Join local real estate investor groups
4. Network with other investors

### Method 4: Direct Mail Campaigns

**Target Lists to Mail:**
- Absentee owners (don't live at property)
- Tax delinquent properties
- Pre-foreclosure lists
- Probate/inherited properties
- Divorce filings
- Code violations
- High equity homeowners

**Where to Get Lists:**
- PropStream ($99/month)
- BatchLeads
- ListSource
- County tax records (free)

**Sample Direct Mail Letter:**

```
Dear [Owner Name],

I noticed you own the property at [Address] and wanted 
to reach out personally. I'm a local investor looking 
to purchase homes in [City].

If you've ever thought about selling, I'd love to make 
you a fair cash offer. I buy homes as-is, which means:

✓ No repairs needed
✓ No agent commissions
✓ Close in as little as 14 days
✓ I handle all paperwork

Even if you're not ready to sell today, I'd be happy 
to chat about your options.

Call or text me anytime: [Your Phone]

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```
